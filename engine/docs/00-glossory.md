### `Asks[i]`

### `Bids[i]`

Index `i` starts from 1.  
Buy orders are sorted in descending order by price.  
Therefore, `Bids.top` is equivalent to `Bids[1]`.

### `Asks[i].price`
The ask price at the i-th row of the order book.

### `Bids[i].price`
The bid price at the i-th row of the order book.

### `Bids[i].amount`

The price difference between the highest bid and the lowest ask.  
Calculated as:  
`Spread = Bids.top.price - Asks.top.price`

### `MidPrice`

Calculated as:  
`MidPrice = (Bids.top.price + Asks.top.price) / 2`
